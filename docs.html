            <h1>About sChat</h1>
            <p>
              sChat (or SimpleChat or SimpleChat.Support) is an open source and very basic
              live chat app written by a JavaScript/Meteor developer. It is free and MIT
              licensed. You can create your own self-hosted copy of
              the app. If you need to, you can also take a look at the code and copy some
              parts of the app. This is a great option when you already have your Meteor
              app and you just need to integrate SimpleChat admin panel into it. You can
              modify the app as you want and leaving a link to the original version
              somewhere would be much appreciated.
            </p>
            <h2>How it works?</h2>
            <p>
              SimpleChat Meteor app is divided into two logical parts. First is the main
              Meteor app - a good example is this website with an administration panel for
              logged in operators/administrators. The second part is a client app widget,
              which is just two files - JavaScript and CSS file. The client app widget
              could be also a Meteor package or any other future, ready-to-use
              integration. The two parts are separate and communicate using only special
              protocol named <a href="https://www.meteor.com/ddp">DDP</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
              As an operator, this allows you to log in and see all chat sessions from
              your all connected client websites - the websites where you've installed the
              client widget. This way, your visitors will be able to see the chat widget
              and write directly to you and you’ll be able to log in to your admin account
              and reply. You can also enable e-mail notifications, so with every new chat
              session, an e-mail will be sent to your mailbox.
            </p>
            <p>
              This app is similar to many other available live chat apps out there. It
              only has basic functionality and the main app is built with Meteor. If you
              don't like this approach or you need something with more features, this is
              not for you. But if you just need a chat box widget for free with flexible
              options and simple Meteor integration (just add the package in your Meteor
              app), this app is for you.
            </p>
            <h2>How to start?</h2>
            <p>
              You can download (git clone) the entire app from the <a
                href="https://github.com/juliancwirko/s-chat-app/issues">GitHub
                repository</a>. This is a standard Meteor app so you need to have Meteor
              installed and you also need Meteor hosting for production. You'll read more
              about it here: <a href="#self-hosted-option"
                class="js-docs-link">Self-hosted Option</a>.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div id="self-hosted-option" class="client-app-content-docs">
            <h1>Self-hosted Option</h1>
            <p>
              sChat is an open source and MIT licensed app so you can just copy it, modify
              it, and use it on your own Meteor server. It is built with Meteor, so basic
              knowledge of Meteor and related packages is necessary here. If you don't
              know Meteor and want to learn it, just go to the <a
                href="https://www.meteor.com/install">tutorials website</a>. You can also
              see the <a href="http://guide.meteor.com/">Meteor Guide</a>. If you just
              want a working app and need a Meteor developer, you can check the website:
              <a href="https://www.weworkmeteor.com/">We Work Meteor</a> or you can just
              hire me :) In that case, take a look at the <a href="#s-chat-support"
                class="js-docs-link">sChat Support section</a>.
            </p>

            <h2>sChat App Structure</h2>

            <p>sChat is a standard Meteor app with Blaze as a view layer. For now, it’s
              Blaze because it is sufficient and really simple to learn so many people who
              want to use the self-hosted version will be able to start very quickly.
              However, if there are more features and problems with performance and code
              management in the future, it is more likely that it will be rewritten in,
              for example, React. But for now it is Blaze and it will stay here.</p>

            <p>
              The folder and file structure is quite standard. We have 'client', 'server',
              'both' and 'public' folders - <a
                href="http://docs.meteor.com/#/full/structuringyourapp">standard Meteor
                folders</a>. In the ‘client', you'll find some other parts which are
              self-explanatory. There are Blaze views with logic, client side collections
              and, of course, styles. In the 'server' folder, we have all server side
              logic so publications, methods, and configurations. In the 'both' folder, we
              have the collection initialization and also routing settings.
            </p>

            <h2>Meteor packages</h2>

            <p>
              There are some Meteor packages used in this app, some of which are community
              based. You can find the list in the '.meteor/packages' file. You can also
              run the command 'meteor list' to list all used packages. If you want to know
              more about them, just Google them or try to find them on <a
                href="https://atmospherejs.com/">Atmospherejs.com</a>.
            </p>

            <h2>sChat App Settings</h2>
            <p>There are some settings which are needed to run your own instance of sChat
              App. These are located in the standard Meteor's .json files. Here we have 2
              types of settings files in the 'settings' folder. There is 'prod.json' file
              and also 'dev.json' file. This is because, in most cases, you want to have
              one configuration for local development and one for production. Remember
              that you shouldn't put theses files in your public repositories. Those are
              private settings which shouldn't be published anywhere.</p>
            <p>Let's see what we can set up here:</p>

            <pre><code class="hljs javascript">{
            <span class="hljs-string">"public"</span>: {
                <span class="hljs-string">"hostName"</span>: <span class="hljs-string">"www.simplechat.support"</span>,
                <span class="hljs-string">"maxClientApps"</span>: <span class="hljs-number">3</span>,
                <span class="hljs-string">"maxChatHistoryInDays"</span>: <span class="hljs-number">3</span>,
                <span class="hljs-string">"ga"</span>: {
                    <span class="hljs-string">"account"</span>: <span class="hljs-string">"UA-********-*"</span>
                }
            },
            <span class="hljs-string">"private"</span>: {
                <span class="hljs-string">"mainAppEmail"</span>: <span class="hljs-string">"your-email-address@gmail.com"</span>,
                <span class="hljs-string">"mailGun"</span>: <span class="hljs-string">"smtp://{Default SMTP Login}:{Default Password}@{SMTP Hostname}:587"</span>,
                <span class="hljs-string">"google"</span>: {
                    <span class="hljs-string">"clientId"</span>: <span class="hljs-string">"{your google API client id here}"</span>,
                    <span class="hljs-string">"secret"</span>: <span class="hljs-string">"{your google API secret key here}"</span>
                },
                <span class="hljs-string">"facebook"</span>: {
                    <span class="hljs-string">"appId"</span>: <span class="hljs-string">"{your facebook API app id here}"</span>,
                    <span class="hljs-string">"secret"</span>: <span class="hljs-string">"{your facebook API secret key here}"</span>
                }
            }
        }
        </code></pre>

            <p>
              Host name and main app e-mail are needed to configure e-mail messages. Max
              client apps and max chat history are just limitations for available client
              apps per account and chat message history in days. Next, you have very
              important settings related to 3rd party services. sChat app needs some
              e-mail service to be able to send e-mails. Here we use <a
                href="https://mailgun.com">MailGun</a>. You need to create your account at
              Mailgun.com and then fill in the 'mailGun' field with your credentials in
              the settings files.
            </p>

            <p>
              Next we have special Google and Facebook API keys which are needed when you
              want to use 'login with Google', 'login with Facebook' buttons. You can
              disable these features in 'both/accounts/s-id-config.js'. It is provided by
              the sId Meteor package. You can read more about it here: <a
                href="http://s-id.meteor.com">s-id.meteor.com</a>.
            </p>

            <p>
              Google Analitics code ('ga' property) is of course optional.
            </p>

            <p><strong>Important:</strong> When you provide all those settings, you need
              to run your Meteor app with '--settings' flag. Example.</p>

            <pre><code class="hljs bash">$ meteor --settings settings/dev.json
        </code></pre>

            <pre><code class="hljs bash">$ meteor --settings settings/prod.json
        </code></pre>

            <h2>Where can I host my custom sChat app?</h2>
            <p>You need NodeJS based hosting and also MongoDB hosting.</p>
            <p>
              There are couple of options. You can use special Meteor apps dedicated to
              the cloud hosting called Galaxy. There is a developer option which is much
              cheaper than others. <a
                href="https://www.meteor.com/why-meteor/pricing">Galaxy</a> is great
              because it gives you many preconfigured features, like simple SSL
              installation, one-line-command deploys, statistics and support. It is
              managed by Meteor Development Group, so the support team knows exactly what
              Meteor apps need.
            </p>
            <p>
              But many people host their Meteor apps in many other ways, for example on <a
                href="https://m.do.co/c/f2346a20e8ce">DigitalOcean</a> using the tool
              called <a href="https://github.com/arunoda/meteor-up">MUP</a>. There is also
              <a href="https://modulus.io/">Modulus</a>, which is very popular in the
              Meteor community.
            </p>
            <p>
              With Galaxy and other options, you’ll also need MongoDB hosting. There are
              some services, for example <a href="https://www.compose.io/">Compose.io</a>
              or <a href="https://mongolab.com/">MongoLab</a>. If you want, you can also
              create your own hosting environment. Many people host MongoDB and app files
              in one place, for example on <a
                href="https://m.do.co/c/f2346a20e8ce">DigitalOcean</a>.
            </p>
            <p>SimpleChat.Support is hosted on Galaxy and MongoLab.</p>

            <h2>I need help!</h2>
            <p>
              If you don't want to use sChat here as a SaaS free option, and you need your
              own version of the app but you don't know how to run your own, you could
              search for help in the <a href="https://forums.meteor.com/">Meteor

              website.
            </p>
            <p>
              I can also offer you my help. Take a look here: <a href="#s-chat-support"
                class="js-docs-link">sChat/Meteor Support</a>.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div id="schat-features" class="client-app-content-docs">
            <h1>sChat admin panel features</h1>
            <p>There are some major features which we should describe here. First of all,
              when you log in, you'll see all your existing client apps. You can go and
              see chat sessions in a particular app by clicking on the 'Open Chats'
              button. This will redirect you to the chat sessions view. On the left you'll
              have the chat sessions list and on the right chat boxes panel. You can open
              a chat box by clicking on the list's item in the sidebar on the right side.
              When the chat box opens, you are ready to reply.</p>
            <p>The chat sessions list has some very useful icon buttons. We will describe
              them in the sections below.</p>
            <h2>Chat sessions list</h2>
            <p>This is a list of all chat sessions. They could be current chats or those
              from the archive. So, how do you know which is an active chat and which is
              not?</p>
            <p>
              This is really quite simple. All chats which you haven’t yet replied to will
              have the 'bell icon' beside it. This icon looks like that: <i
                class="ti-bell docs-icon"></i>. It will appear when there is a new message
              from your client. When you answer the icon disappears. What if you don't
              answer? The icon will still be there, but you can always check the last
              message date and time on the list and decide if there is a need to answer.
            </p>
            <p>All chat sessions will be automatically deleted when the first client
              message in the session is older than three days.</p>
            <p>
              When you click on an item on the list, chat box will open. Also you will
              find the 'message' icon near the clicked list item which looks like: <i
                class="ti-comment-alt docs-icon"></i>. This means that the current chat
              session is open and displayed as a chat box.
            </p>
            <p>
              There are two more icon buttons on the chat sessions list. With these icons,
              you can ban users by IP. The icon looks like: <i
                class="ti-na docs-icon"></i> and also you can remove all chat messages by
              user IP or Session ID. The icon looks like <i
                class="ti-close docs-icon"></i>. Icons will appear when your mouse cursor
              is over a particular item, which is hard to miss. When you click on the
              'ban' icon, there should be a modal box with confirmation, but you’re able
              to undo this operation if you choose. If you click on the 'remove' icon,
              there should be a modal box with two radio inputs (remove by IP and remove
              by Session Id).
            </p>

            <h2>Ban list and E-mail notifications</h2>
            <p>On the particular client app view where you can open chat boxes in the top
              right corner, you’ll find some of the icons which are responsible for
              managing banned IP addresses and e-mail notifications.</p>
            <p>
              When you want to add or remove an IP address to/from your ‘ban-list’, you
              can click on the flag icon which should look like <i
                class="ti-flag docs-icon"></i>. It will open a modal box with all banned
              IP addresses and you can add more or remove some as you wish.
            </p>
            <p>E-mail notifications is a really cool feature because it can send you a new
              e-mail when a new chat session appears, so you don't need to track your chat
              sessions list all the time. In the future, there will be more notification
              options.</p>
            <p>Other icons here are just help icons and they aren’t that important.</p>

            <h2>User account operations</h2>
            <p>You can, of course, delete your user account any time you want. Just
              remember that all your client apps will be removed too and all your chat
              boxes will stop working. You can also change your password. All the buttons
              are in the top right corner of the website, of course when you are logged
              in.</p>
